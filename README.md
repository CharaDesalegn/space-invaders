This is the coolest game I’ve ever made! You can use different gun powers and even heal yourself during the game. 

There are some bugs and errors I haven’t fixed yet — I like keeping them because they remind me of how I built the game.

Through this project, I learned a lot about object-oriented programming and game development.

I created it on September, 2024.
